<h2>Alternating bit demo</h2>
Your code should be able to pass the tests shown below.
<p>
Note: the file <tt>checksum_demo.cpp</tt> shows how to
use the <tt>checksum</tt> function in <tt>link_layer.cpp</tt>.

<h2>Download and check</h2>
Download the <a href="alternating_bit_demo.zip">Demo code<a>.
Unpack the code:
<pre>
	unzip alternating_bit_demo.zip
</pre>
Compile all the code:
<pre>
	cd alternating_bit_demo
	bash make_all.sh
</pre>
There should be no compile errors.

<h2>Running the tests</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Timeout test<dd>
This test makes a single call to <tt>a_link_layer->send</tt>.
Then the user is prompted at the keyboard and the program
waits for a reply.
Until that reply comes, the a-side link layer should keep timing out
and resending the original packet.
Place a <tt>cout</tt> message in the function <tt>resend</tt>
to show each time the packet is resent.
<dt>Simple two-way test<dd>
This test calls <tt>a_link_layer->send</tt> and
<tt>b_link_layer->send</tt> whenever <tt>receive_ready</tt> returns true.
Physical layer corruption is set to corrupt every 10th byte
in the a-to-b direction.
Your code should overcome the corruption and successfully complete
every Link Layer send.
